# TopWordFrequency Program - Pipeline Style

## Overview
--------
The `Six` program is a Pipeline-style Java application that:

Reads a text file to analyze.
- Normalizes the characters by removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.
- Splits the cleaned text into individual words.
- Removes stop words (common, uninformative words).
- Counts the frequency of each remaining word.
- Sorts the words by frequency in descending order.
- Prints the top 25 most frequent words.e.

This version uses a modular, function-based pipeline structure, where each transformation step is defined in a separate method and passed through sequentially, resembling Unix-style command chaining.

## Constraints
--------
- No long jumps.
- Complexity of control flow tamed by dividing the large problem into
smaller units using procedural abstraction. Procedures are pieces of functionality that may take input, but that donâ€™t necessarily produce output
that is relevant for the problem.
- Procedures may share state in the form of global variables.
- The larger problem is solved by applying the procedures, one after the
other, that change, or add to, the shared state.

## Project Folder Structure
------------------------
Place the following files in the same folder:

- Six.java           // The Java source code file
- test.txt            // Input text files to be analyzed
- stopwords.txt       // File containing comma-separated stop words

Example stopwords.txt:
a,an,the,in,of,to,for,with,is,was,and,by,on,from,at

## How to Compile and Run
-----------------------

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal

2. Navigate to the source folder where the Java file and text files are located.

   Example:
   cd path\to\your\folder
   (replace with actual path)

3. Compile the program:
   javac Four.java

4. Run the program:
   java Four test.txt stopwords.txt

The program will output the top 25 most frequent words in the file, excluding stopwords.

## Expected Output Example
------------------------
Top 25 words:
love: 123

elizabeth: 87

darcy: 79

mr: 75

time: 63

...

## NOTES
-----
- This implementation uses Java's built-in libraries (`java.util.*`, `java.nio.file.*`) for list, map, and file operations.
- The program recursively prints the word frequencies using a helper method.
- The `stopwords.txt` file must be in the same directory as the program and should contain stop words separated by commas.
- The program automatically ignores all single-letter words (a-z) as part of the stop words list.
- Clean modular structure makes this version easier to extend or refactor.
